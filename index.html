        <h1>Step 01</h1>
        <p>Before operating the device, carefully read and understand all instructions. Make sure the device is positioned on a flat, dry, and stable surface prior to use. When testing the device, wear proper footwear and avoid sharp heels or spikes. Use the device only in dry environments, and never operate it in wet or damp conditions. Do not jump on the device or apply excessive force beyond normal walking pressure. Keep all electrical components away from moisture and heat to prevent damage or hazards. Do not disassemble or alter any internal components unless you are authorized to do so. Children should not tamper with the device’s connections without adult supervision. If any unusual sounds, smells, or sparks are detected, immediately stop operation and inspect the device.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="safety-guide-text-two">
        <h1>Step 02</h1>
        <p>It is essential to refrain from modifying the device or any of its components without proper authorization, as unauthorized alterations can compromise the device's safety, functionality, and warranty. The design and structure of the device have been carefully engineered to operate within specific parameters, and any modifications may lead to malfunctions or safety hazards. Additionally, users should avoid applying excessive force beyond what is typical for normal walking pressure. Excessive pressure can damage internal mechanisms, reduce the lifespan of the device, or create unsafe conditions during use.When demonstrating the device to children or individuals who are unfamiliar with its operation, close supervision is necessary at all times. Children, in particular, may not recognize potential risks or understand the importance of correct usage, making it critical for a knowledgeable adult to oversee their interaction with the device. Ensuring that untrained users are guided appropriately helps maintain a safe environment and supports proper understanding and handling of the equipment.</p>
